# 🌟 Product Vision – FeatureFlow

## 🎯 Goal
Build a simple, open-source tool to collect feature requests and organize them for prioritization and planning.

## 👤 Who is it for?
- Indie developers
- Startups
- Product managers

## 💡 Why it matters
User feedback is critical, but it's often scattered. This tool creates a lightweight, structured way to gather and view feedback in one place.

## 🔮 Future Plans
- Add voting on requests
- Connect directly to a database
- Add admin panel for approving/denying requests
